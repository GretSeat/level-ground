# Level Ground, MMA Gym
At Level Ground (LG), urban youth cultivate grit and resilience through Mixed Martial Arts. They learn to apply these values 'off the mat' in the pursuit of their ambitions through our Student Trainer Certification and College Access programs.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Building this landing page, I started with all of the HTML, making it geared towards accessibility, and screen readers. I tried using as many sections and class names to add to readability and ease of use. The CSS is where I got to have fun with things. I code to spend my time designing the site to be easily readable, but also have an impact that only an MMA Gym could provide. 

## Optimizations
I originally made the entire site using vh and vw units. It looked amazing, and it sure was responsive when it came to going from wide screen monitors to mobile screens. However, it was not optimized for users that have visual impairments, and you could not zoom in and out on the page. So I changed all of my units to rem units, and used media queries, so now users that have any visual impairments would be able to enjoy the site. 

## Lessons Learned:

During this project I learned how to properly use rems, and not using vh/vw for everything.
