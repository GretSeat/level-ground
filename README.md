## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Building this landing page, I started with all of the HTML, making it geared towards accessibility, and screen readers. I tried using as many sections and class names to add to readability and ease of use. The CSS is where I got to have fun with things. I code to spend my time designing the site to be easily readable, but also have an impact that only an MMA Gym could provide. 

## Optimizations
I originally made the entire site using vh and vw units. It looked amazing, and it sure was responsive when it came to going from wide screen monitors to mobile screens. However, it was not optimized for users that have visual impairments, and you could not zoom in and out on the page. So I changed all of my units to rem units, and used media queries, so now users that have any visual impairments would be able to enjoy the site. 

## Lessons Learned:

During this project I learned how to properly use rems, and not using vh/vw for everything. While I was doing the project, it might have seemed easier to just use Viewport Height, and Viewport Width to make my website incredibly responsive, but it ended up biting me when I tried to zoom in and out on the page, and realized nothing was moving. On top of that I was using GitHub to track my changes, and when I was going through changing my vw/vh to rems I made a new branch and ended up having to learn a lesson the hard way about how to properly use branches, and roll back commits.
